# Messier Objects Map
Python notebook which shows the 10 nearest Messier objects as a 3D plot
This project renders a static 3d plot and notebook natively on GitHub, without some of the 3D features enabled. 
If you run the program inside a Jupyter notebook, zooming and rotating the plot will work as well.
